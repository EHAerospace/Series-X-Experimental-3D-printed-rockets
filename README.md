# Series-X-Experimental-3D-printed-rockets
EHAerospace experimental 3D printed rockets for spin stabilization testing. Caution, this rockets haven't any warranty of flying correctly, this rockets are highly experimental.
They were ·D printed in PLA and glued with epoxy. The motors they used were comercial D12-5 motors.
# Dragonlady
This is the first rocket of the X series of EHA. This rocket, full 3d printed, was used for experimental purposes about spint stabilization in rockets.
# MOFAN
This is other highly experimental rocket as Dragonlady. Was tested succesfully in real flight with experimental launchpad.
# WICOM
This one fully 3D printed as the two mentioned before was succesfully launched and recovered.

*NOTE: *we are not responsable about the use of this rockets if used.They have no warranty of stable flight. They have been   tested in secure areas.
